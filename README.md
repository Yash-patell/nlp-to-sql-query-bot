# nlp-to-sql-query-bot
This project leverages LSTM models to convert natural language inputs, provided either as text or speech, into SQL queries. It allows users to interactively generate SQL commands based on conversational prompts, making database querying more accessible to those without SQL knowledge.

# Features

Execute SQL queries on a target database.

Display results in a user-friendly format.

Support for common SQL operations (SELECT, WHERE, JOIN, GROUP BY, etc.).

Easy integration with frontend (Streamlit, Flask, etc.).

Optional: Voice input for questions.
